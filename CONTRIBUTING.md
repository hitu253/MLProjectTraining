<h1>I'm currently working on a model that would work like a human and would be able to differentiate between various objects that exist in the world , so for training the model I would need a lot of data .</h1>

# If you want to contribute to this project and help me out you can do the following :


ðŸŽ‡Add a minimum of 10 images of any object that would help me train the model.

ðŸŽ‡Add any alogorithm or code that would help me train the model.

ðŸŽ‡A data set of the objects  in a seperate folder will be appreciated.

ðŸŽ‡Create a new folder in the repository and add your files or images.


The pull requests will be merged as quick as possible.

Hope you guys would contribute to this project and start your Open-Source Journey.

# NOTE FOR ALL CONTRIBUTIONS

Dataset is a data collection that a data engineer will process to become a machine learning model. To help their works create models, please provide **only** worth of data into these repositories. Because a machine learning model needs good data to gain high accuracy. I have arranged this repository into some topics to which you are worth contributing to. Here are the topics.

1. Animals
2. Entertainment
3. Flowers
4. Fruit
5. Human
6. Places
7. Project
8. RoadSigns
9. Source Code
10. Things
11. Transportation
12. Vegetables

Please consider that you are adding your data to the correct place above. Maybe in one or two topics, there are `Others` directory. It's a useless dataset that can't be used in model creations. Please, don't add to these places.

For `Source Code`, put here only if you are adding a source code-based project. Just remember, don't send spam. It doesn't help at all. For `Project`, put here your project or idea you want to add. It will be better if you add documentation to it.

Finally, Happy Hacktoberfest.
